                    <p>It is always best to see out your current order of calls. This is so that we can fulfil the order first before you re order. You will be notified by email once your are approaching the end of your call order.</p>

                     <h5>Answer</h5>

                    <p>There is no real maximum level of calls that you can order at any one time but what we advise is to start off with a low volume of calls, make sure you are happy with the Call Monster then increase your orders in line with how busy you want to get</p>
                    <p>
There is a minimum order of 5 calls, this is because it takes the Call Monster team time to build out your campaign.

                    <p>If you miss a call, don’t worry. The Call Monster will deliver you a full report of every number who has tried to call you. Simply ring them back. You will still be charged for missed calls at the normal agreed rate. </p>

                    <p>We optimise your specific Call Monster campaign so that you will only ever get calls from people genuinely looking/searching for your products or services, however if you feel that a call was completely irrelevant to what you offer then submit a support ticket <a href="mailto:support@callmonster.com">support@callmonster.com</a> and we will listen to the call. If we decide that this was an irrelevant call then we will credit your account with another call.</p>

                    <p>When you are nearing the end of your ordered call limit you will receive a notification through email to make another order. Don’t let anyone else receive those calls.</p>

                     <h5>Answer</h5>

                    <p>We will notify you if this happens. If a competitor contacts Call Monster and puts in a quote for the same services in the same area then we will advise you and offer you first refusal on an exclusivity deal for those calls. This will be a fixed monthly fee for 6 months and payable regardless of whether you place any call orders. We advise that if you take out an exclusivity deal with the Call Monster then you should always make an order for the minimum amount of calls each month. After 6 month you will get first refusal on whether to renew the deal for another 6 months rolling agreement.</p>
                    <p>Call monster is dedicated to rewarding our loyal customers so If an exclusivity deal is taken out, the price per call will be reduced.</p>
